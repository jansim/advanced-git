## What is GitLab?

- GitLab is a FOSS project to host your own website for git repositories
- GitLab.com is their SaaS offering
- By having your git repository online, you can easily collaborate with others
- There are many other similar, alternative websites
  - Codeberg üá©üá™
  - GitHub
  - Bitbucket
  - ... (and many more)
- Together they contain the majority of the world's software

## Why use a Website?

- Backup of your project
- Collaboration
  - Not just with people you know
- Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)
- Visibility

# Connecting git and GitLab

## Authenticating with GitLab.com üóùÔ∏è {background-color="black"}

::: {.nonincremental}

- We will use a guide to set up the authentication with GitHub
- Please go to the [website](https://simson.io/advanced-git/output/resources/ssh/how-to-setup-gitlab-ssh.html) and follow the steps to authenticate with GitHub
- A PDF version of the guide can be found [here](./resources/ssh/how-to-setup-github-ssh.pdf)

## Remotes

- Link to a remote repository on a hosting website
- There can be more than one remote, but it is uncommon
- Just like your repository, the remote repository also has branches
- The default name for a remote is `origin`
  - When you `clone` a repository, this remote is already linked

## Adding a Remote

When you want to add an existing repository to github, you will have to add the remote yourself

```bash
git remote add <remote name> <remote URL>
```

<br>

::: {.fragment}
For example:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:jansim/intro-to-git.git
```

<br>

::: {.fragment}
To learn about all possible commands for remotes use `-h`

```bash
git remote -h
```

## Syncing Changes: Overview

You first `pull` the latest changes from the remote and then `push` your own changes

![](images/drawings/pull-push.svg)

## Getting Changes: `git pull`

- You can retrieve the latest changes from github by running `git pull`
- This *fetches* the latest changes and *merges* them into your current branch
- Typically your local branch is set up to *track* a remote branch with the same name
  - If not, you get a warning from git

::: {.fragment}
```bash
# Pull from the tracked remote branch
git pull

# Pull from a specific branch
git pull <remote>/<branch>
```
:::

## Getting Changes: `git pull`

- This *fetches* the latest changes and *merges* them into your current branch
  - `git pull` really does *two* things here
- You can also run `git fetch` to fetch the latest changes and then `git merge <remote>/branch` to merge them
- `git fetch` will always fetch the latest changes without doing anything with them (which can be useful)

## Pushing Your Changes: `git push`

- You can send *your* changes to github by running `git push`
- This only works if there are no new changes at the remote
  - If there have been changes since your last `pull` you need to `pull` again

::: {.fragment}
```bash
# Push to the tracked remote branch
git push

# Push to a specific branch
git push <remote>/<branch>
```

# Pull / Merge Requests

## Pull / Merge Requests (PRs / MRs)

- When collaborating with other people, it's often good to review each other's changes
- This is easiest done by using pull or merge requests
  - You *request* for someone to *pull* your changes
- Terminology
  - GitHub: Pull Requests
  - GitLab: Merge Requests

## merge requests: Overview

## When Should you start using Issues & MRs?

- Maybe your project doesn't need these features yet
- Often it makes sense to use PR / MRs even when collaborating with just a few people
  - To avoid merge conflicts
  - Also for reviewing each others changes
- Many companies require code reviews and using MRs

## Practical: Collaborating via GitLab {background-color="black"}

1. Fork the Website Template Repository: <https://gitlab.com/jansim/website-template>
2. Clone your forked repository
3. Add an alumni page by following the instructions in `docs/alumni/index.md`
4. Push your changes to GitLab and create a MR to add yourself as an alumni
