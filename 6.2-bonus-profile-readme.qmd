## Adding a profile README

- You can provide some extra information about yourself using a special `README` on GitHub
- This will be displayed on your user profile
- Special repository that exactly matches your username
  - `<username>/<username>`
  - My username is `jansim`, so the repository has to be named `jansim` as well
- Only visible if repo is public
- Inspiration: <bit.ly/awesome-gh>

## Practical: Your Own Website {background-color="black"}

1. Create a new repository matching your username
2. Add a `README` to the repository
3. Play around a bit with how it looks on your GitHub user profile
