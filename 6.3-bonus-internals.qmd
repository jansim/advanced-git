# Anatomy of a Repository {background-color="black" background-opacity="0.5" background-image="images/backgrounds/head-medical-phrenology-yAUuzHD05hftq7D2T2.webp"}

## The Anatomy of a `git` Repository 🫀

Inside `.git/`.

- `objects/`: Actual data / contents
- `refs/`: Points to commits (e.g. `branches`, `tags`)
- `logs/`: History for `reflog`
- `HEAD`: Points to the current HEAD e.g. a branch or commit
- `config`: Repository-specific configuration settings
- `index`: Staging area

## Let's look at it in practice! 👀

Demo: Looking inside `.git/` (including index/staging).

::: {.callout-warning}
Messing with a git repository has a high chance of ruining it. Only do this with repositories that you have plenty of backups of or ones that are not important.
:::

```sh
# Helper to decompress binary files
alias deflate="perl -MCompress::Zlib -e 'undef $/; print uncompress(<>)'"
```

## Practical: Look inside! 👀 {background-color="black"}

1. Look inside the `.git` folder of your cookbook repository.
2. Stage files and look at the index changing (in size)
2. Make a new commit and see whether you can notice some changes
