## Advanced GitHub/Lab

- You can easily start an in-browser version of VSCode
  - Just press the `.` key, inside a repository
- You can mark who is responsible for which parts of a repository
  - `CODEOWNERS` file
  - Similar to `.gitignore` patterns, associated with usernames
- These work on both GitHub & GitLab

## Making your Repository Citeable

- You can assign a doi (digital object identifier) to your repository using [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/about)
  - Steps are outlined in this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content)
- You can also add an official `CITATION` file, so people know how to cite the repository
  - Steps are outlined in this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files)
