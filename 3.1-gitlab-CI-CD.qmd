## From before: CI / CD

- Continuous Integration (CI)
  - Integration of changes from multiple developers into shared repository with automated testing.
- Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)
  - Automated deployment of changes if previous tests pass.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Ensuring the quality of all code that makes it into the main branch.

- Automatically check
  - different forms of tests
  - formatting
  - building / compilation
  - ...
- Only allow merging if tests pass

## Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)

Automatically deploy the latest state upon merge.

- Build & deploy the latest version
  - If tests pass
- Helps streamlining deployment
- Easier to roll-back changes

## Artifacts

Save / export files from your CI / CD pipeline.

- Typically more related to CD, but not necessarily
- Build, package and release your software
- Can help to debug failing tests
  - e.g. upload a plot from a failed test as artifact

# CI / CD on GitLab

## CI / CD on GitLab: Pipelines & Jobs

GitLab's CI/CD system is organized into pipelines which contain one or more jobs.

- Each job performs a task
- Multiple jobs can be chained / combined in a pipeline
- There is no clear distinction between CI/CD, it's all jobs

## CI / CD on GitLab: Runners

- Jobs run in Docker containers (more later)
- These need to run *somewhere*: runners
- Runners are separate from the gitlab instance itself
  - We'll use gitlab.com here, which provides a certain amount of free "minutes"
- KIT does not provide runners by default
  - But you can provide your own

## Testing CI / CD Pipelines

- Option 1: Make changes, push, repeat ‚ôªÔ∏è
- Option 2: Use tools to test locally
  - [`gitlab-runner exec`](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/)
  - [`gitlab-ci-local`](https://github.com/firecow/gitlab-ci-local)

## Practical: Deploying a Website {background-color="black"}

You can deploy your own website on gitlab.com using GitLab Pages.

1. Go to the fork of the website template ([jansim/website-template](https://gitlab.com/jansim/website-template)) you made earlier.
2. Make at least one commit to let the CI run (should have happened already)
3. Go to `Build` > `Pipelines` on the left to check whether everything ran correctly
4. Go to `Deploy` > `Pages` to check whether the configuration for deployments was correct
5. The deployment should look roughly like [this](https://jansim.gitlab.io/website-template).

# Going Deeper: <br> `.gitlab-ci.yml`

## Detour: (Docker) Containers üêã

- Collection of software and its dependencies
- Kind of like a mini-virtual machine
- Identified by an image name e.g. `ubuntu:20.04`, `postgres:14`, `...`
- Docker is the biggest company in the space, but open-source implementations exist

## The magic file: `.gitlab-ci.yml` ‚ú®

```yml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
stages: # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job: # This job runs in the build stage, which runs first.
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Hello, $GITLAB_USER_LOGIN!"
    - echo "Compiling the code..."
    - echo "Compile complete."

unit-test-job: # This job runs in the test stage.
  stage: test  # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
    - sleep 60
    - echo "Code coverage is 90%"

lint-test-job: # This job also runs in the test stage.
  stage: test # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
  script:
    - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
    - sleep 10
    - echo "No lint issues found."

deploy-job: # This job runs in the deploy stage.
  stage: deploy # It only runs when *both* jobs in the test stage complete successfully.
  environment: production
  script:
    - echo "Deploying application..."
    - echo "Application successfully deployed."
```

## A more complicated example

```yml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build-job:
  stage: build
  image: node
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "build/"
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

lint-markdown:
  stage: test
  image: node
  dependencies: []
  script:
    - npm install markdownlint-cli2 --global
    - markdownlint-cli2 -v
    - markdownlint-cli2 "blog/**/*.md" "docs/**/*.md"
  allow_failure: true
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

test-html:
  stage: test
  image: node
  dependencies:
    - build-job
  script:
    - npm install --save-dev htmlhint
    - npx htmlhint --version
    - npx htmlhint build/
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'merge_request_event'
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

pages:
  stage: deploy
  dependencies:
    - build-job
  script:
    - mv build/ public/
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - "public/"
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```

## Major Practical: Creating your own real-world Pipeline{background-color="black"}

1. Build teams of 3 or more people
2. Create a new repository and set up a sample CI/CD pipeline in a language you work with on a day-to-day basis
3. Ideally, this is a stepping stone for a CI/CD you'll use in production
