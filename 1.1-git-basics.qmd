# The Classic Git Flow

## The 3 Levels of Changes in git

![Changes can be either unstaged, staged or commited.](images/drawings/git-areas.png)

- When we first make a change it is *unstaged*
- Once we `add` the change to the staging area it is *staged*
- We can then `commit` all *staged* changes

- We can `restore` the commited version (and remove any *unstaged* changes)
:::

## A small `add`endum: `git add -i`

You can also *interactively* add changes with `-i`.

```bash
git add -i
#            staged     unstaged path
#   1:    unchanged        +4/-0 1.1-git-basics.qmd

# *** Commands ***
#   1: status       2: update       3: revert       4: add untracked
#   5: patch        6: diff         7: quit         8: help
# What now> 
```

There's also an [extension](https://github.com/cwarden/git-add--interactive) available.

## Practical: Cookbook (1) {background-color="black"}

1. Create a new directory called `git-example`
2. Initialize a git repository in the new directory
3. Create a new file `cookbook.md` in your `git-example` directory
4. Search for your favorite recipe online and copy the title into the file
   - Tip: Use english language recipes
5. Commit the changes
6. Add the ingredients into the file and commit them, too

## Practical: Cookbook (2) {background-color="black"}

1. Add the cooking steps into the file and commit them
2. Delete the `cookbook.md` and restore it
3. Explore the repo status & history
4. Add a second recipe step by step

## Expanding on `.gitgnore`

- Old news: You can ignore files by adding them to `.gitignore` 📰
- Maybe new: You can reverse ignored files with a `!`
  - e.g. `dir/**` and `!dir/.gitkeep`
- Ignoring a directory: `dir/` vs. `dir/**`
  - **Q:** What will happen with `dir/` and `!dir/.gitkeep`?
- ❗️ With `dir/`, the whole directory is ignored and *git will not scan it at all*

## Empty directories: `.gitignore` > `.gitkeep` 📂

- git only tracks *files*, not *directories*
- If we want git to create a directory, but ignore all files it needs to track a file in there
- Common convention: Ignore all files except an empty `.gitkeep`
- Better: Create a `.gitgnore` file in the directory with `*` and `!.gitignore`
