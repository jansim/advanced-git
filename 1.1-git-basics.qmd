## What is git?

- Version Control System (VCS)
  - Looks at the changes in your files
  - Records all changes over time to give you a full history
  - Similar to "track changes" in Microsoft Word / LibreOffice

::: {.fragment}

![Git only looks at and tracks the *changes* in a file](images/carpentries/play-changes.svg)

## What is git? *Strengths* & Weaknesses

- Strengths ðŸ’ª
  - Very hard to lose files with git
  - Great for collaboration
  - Fast (like, really fast)
  - History allows you to go back and understand changes or revert when there are problems
  - Reproducibility

## What is git? Strengths & *Weaknesses*

- Weaknesses ðŸ˜¢
  - Can be a bit complicated to use (esp. at first)
  - History takes up file space (but only little)
  - Struggles with binary (i.e. non-text) files
  - Struggles with large files
    - Not good for storing data!
  - You do need to *explicitly* use it i.e. it doesn't just work in the background

## CLI vs. GUI: `git`

- `git` itself is a CLI program
- But, many GUIs are available
  - Sourcetree
  - Visual Studio Code*
  - Rstudio*
  - Github Desktop
  - ... (full list: <https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis>)

::: {.fragment}

*: These programs have a different main purpose, but also offer the option of using git via their GUI.

# The Classic Git Flow

## The 3 Levels of Changes in git

![Changes can be either unstaged, staged or commited.](images/drawings/git-areas.png)

- When we first make a change it is *unstaged*
- Once we `add` the change to the staging area it is *staged*
- We can then `commit` all *staged* changes

![Changes can be either unstaged, staged or commited.](images/drawings/git-areas.png)

::: {.nonincremental}
- We can `restore` the commited version (and remove any *unstaged* changes)

## Practical: git Command Library (1) {background-color="black"}

1. Create a new directory called `git-example`
2. Initialize a git repository in the new directory
3. Create a new file `library.txt` in your `git-example` directory
4. Run `git init -h` and copy the output into your `library.txt`
5. Commit the changes
6. Delete the `library.txt` and restore it

## Demo: Tracking Changes in VSCode

![Since VSCode is primarily a text editor, git functionality is hidden in the sidebar](images/screenshots/vscode-git.png)

- Demo: Default git features in VSCode
- Demo: Advanced features via gitLens

## Practical: git Command Library (2) {background-color="black"}

1. Run `git <command> -h` and copy the output into your `library.txt`
2. Explore the repo status *using the VSCode*
3. Commit the changes (with a good commit message)
4. Repeat steps 2. - 4. for **2 of the commands** we learned so far, using separate commits each time
5. Delete the `library.txt` and restore it
