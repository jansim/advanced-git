## What is Trunk-Based Development?

> A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a single branch called ‘trunk’, resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches by employing documented techniques. They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and live happily ever after.

## What is Trunk-Based Development?

> A source-control branching model, where developers collaborate on code in a **single branch** called ‘trunk’, **resist any pressure to create other long-lived development branches** by employing documented techniques.

> They therefore avoid merge hell, do not break the build, and **live happily ever after**.

## What is Trunk-Based Development?

- Development happens on a single main branch (trunk)
    - At most short-lived feature branches
- Developers commit changes directly to the main / master branch
- Integrates with continuous integration and continuous delivery

## Brief Detour: CI / CD 🤖

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**
    - Integration of changes from multiple developers into shared repository with automated testing.
- **Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)**
  - Automated deployment of changes if previous tests pass.

## How to Get Started with Trunk-Based Development

- Avoid long-lived branches
  - Use a single `trunk` instead (doesn't need to be called so)
- Use feature-branches
- Merge / pull / push often and regularly
- Make sure that any changes you merge can build / run (!)
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline (⏲️)

## Advantages of Trunk-Based Development

1. **Faster Feedback**: Immediate integration identifies conflicts early
2. **Reduced Merge Issues**: Smaller, more frequent merges minimize conflicts
3. **Promotes Collaboration**: Encourages teamwork and shared code ownership
4. **Simplified Deployment**: Continuous integration allows for quicker releases

## Best Practices: feature-branches

- Work in separate branches for each new feature
- Keep them short lived
- Naming
  - `feat-xyz`
  - `<username>/feat-xyz`

## Best Practices

- **Feature Toggles**: Enable features selectively without affecting the main branch
- **Code Reviews**: Ensure high-quality code before merging to trunk
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suites to maintain code stability
- **Monitoring and Rollbacks**: Quickly identify issues and revert changes if necessary

## gitflow 🌊

Formerly highly popular workflow, now a bit out of fashion.

- Development happens in `develop` branch
- Only releases e.g. `v1.2.1` in main / master
- Features also in feature-branches
- Branches are much longer lived
  - Can lead to difficulties with merges
- Many more active branches in general
